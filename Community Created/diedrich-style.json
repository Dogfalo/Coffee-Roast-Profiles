Drop beans at 5sec remaining.\n\nThis profile simulates the Diedrich drum roast slow start / fast finish concept.  The idea is to get to 1st crack at about 11min of heat, and then finish the roast 2-3min later.\n\nTimes quoted are profile times.  If you remove the first step, subtract 30sec from all times.\n\n1st Crack: ~ 12:00\n2nd Crack ~ 14:00\n\nHit cool at any time you like after first crack.  Beans tested with this profile:\n\nPeru - 2min past 1st crack\nSumatra - 20sec into 2nd crack\nGuatemala - 2min past 1st crack"
